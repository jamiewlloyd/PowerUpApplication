                <p class="paragraph">Hi, I'm Jamie. I am currently working as a health care assistant in a local
                    hospital but I have spent the last two years studying in hope of moving into my desired career as a
                    web developer. In summer this year I completed a BTEC extended diploma lvl3 in IT at West Lancashire
                    college, with the final result of D*D*D*. I was apprehensive to go back into education and start the
                    move to a new career, but I loved it. <br>During the course I was introduced to web development
                    and instantly felt drawn to the subject. I have always had interest in both technology and design,
                    and
                    this was an area which merged the two. I am currently self-studying JavaScript and other
                    advanced parts of web development in order to improve my skills, to hopefully soon move into Web
                    Development as my career.

                <p class="paragraph"> The Power Up Digital Bootcamp program offers a lot of knowledge and experience
                    that I feel would be invaluable to my progression towards my career goals. Digital marketing is
                    a massive part of the world today and is found in almost every digital media you can think of.
                    social media, web sites, gaming, mobile applications and more all rely on some form of
                    marketing, weather that be personal branding or corporate. <br>This program offers knowledge of
                    these
                    different marketing styles and techniques, showing how they are applied to business. Most
                    importantly to me, this program offers a look into Web Development, the professional landscape of
                    tech positions and includes the opportunity to
                    network with people who have experience in the tech sector of the business world. </p>
